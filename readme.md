### How to install and run our web app

Not any special installation processes are required other than downloading the whole repository locally and opening the HTML file in any browser.
**P.S.** We used and recommend using Google Chrome for avoiding any functionality disruptions.

### Files and their location

We got 2 folders in our repository, one named **Documentation** and another **Web Application**.\
In the former folder we got **_Jira.pdf_**. In the latter we created 5 new folders named **css** with **_wtp_app.css_** file containing all the CSS styling codes, **js** with **_wtp_app.js_** file containing all the JavaScript codes, **html** with **_wtp_app.html_** file containing all the HTML codes, **logo** with **_Company logo.png_** and **_Company logo no background.png_** (this one used for the favicon) files, and **favicon** with all the necessary files required for the tab icon creation (placed in the appropriate HTML header section and commented).\
Also this **_readme.md_** file is placed outside of the previously mentioned **Documentation** and **Web Application** folders.

### Any external resources used in development

For all the libraries needed we used a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to access the file hosted on the internet. The links are placed and can be found in the header and bottom body sections of the HTML file. The external libraries used are given below:
* Bootstrap frontend toolkit
* Bootstrap Icons icon library
* jQuery JS library
* sweetalert2 package

We have also made use of some website's services given below:

### Further recommendations and future plans

One friendly disclaimer for users would be keeping in mind that all the data **WILL** be loast if page refreshing is attempted.\
One bug which wasn't fixed and left for the future app versions, as it does **NOT** cause any functionality problems, is highlighting issue right after page finishes loading. For more about this bug issue, you can refer to the **_Jira.pdf_** file.
